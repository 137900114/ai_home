    This is an simple abstracted graph search algorithm. You could
    using different combination of fringe storage, calc_heuristic, heuristic
    to implement different search algorithm.

    For example:
    LIFO Queue(Stack), None, None -> Depth First Search
    FIFO Queue, None, None -> Breadth First Search
    PriorityQueue, cost compute function, None -> Uniform Cost Search

    In order to avoid infinite graph/tree problem we setup a list (visited) to
    avoid expanding the same node.

    hint: please check the node first before expanding:

    if node.state not in visited:
        visited.append(node.state)
    else:
        continue

    hint: you could get the successor by problem.get_successor method.

    hint: for fringe you may want to use
        fringe.pop  get a node from the fringe
        fringe.push   put a node into the fringe
        fringe.empty  check whether a fringe is empty or not. If the fringe is empty this function return True
        problem.is_goal_state check whether a state is the goal state
        problem.get_successor get all successor from current state
